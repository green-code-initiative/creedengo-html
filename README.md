# Creedengo-html

_creedengo_ is a collective project aiming to reduce environmental footprint of software at the code level. The goal of
the project is to provide a list of static code analyzers to highlight code structures that may have a negative
ecological impact: energy and resources over-consumption, "fatware", shortening terminals' lifespan, etc.

_creedengo_ is based on evolving catalogs
of [good practices](https://github.com/green-code-initiative/creedengo-rules-specifications/tree/main/docs/rules), for various technologies.
This
SonarQube plugin then implements these catalogs as rules for scanning your HTML projects.
